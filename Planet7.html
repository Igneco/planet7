    <h1>Planet7 - can I release now?</h1>
    <h3>Bread and Butter</h3>
    <p>As a contractor, where does my money come from?</p>
    <ul>
        <li>High-throughput, low latency?</li>
        <li>Cool start-up ideas?</li>
        <li>Low-throughput, high latency, just another corporate website, with a few interfaces, some workflow and some ETL</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Auto-buttering our bread without fear</h3>
    <p>When I release each week (or day/hour/commit) I want to know that I haven't just killed the project/cost the business millions/lost my job</p>
